## Brief
With your team, build a MEAN stack app of your own design. Your app must:

* Use Mongo, Node & Express to build a server-side API
* Your API must have at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* Your API should include all RESTFUL actions for at least one of those models
* Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users
* Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document
* Include automated tests for at least one resource
* Use Angular to build a front-end that consumes your API
* Use SCSS instead of CSS
* Use Webpack & Yarn to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

**Timeframe**: 1 week
